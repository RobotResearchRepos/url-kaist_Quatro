## Demo

## NEWS (23.1.27)
- An improved version is under review in the Interntaitonal Journal of Robotics Research~(IJRR)
- The codes would be refactored and then updated soon!

## Characteristics

* Single hpp file (`include/quatro.hpp`). It requires other hpp files, though :sweat_smile:
* Intuitive usage based on the hierarchical inheritance of the `Registration` class in [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](https://pointclouds.org/). Quatro can be used as follows: 

```c++
// After the declaration of Quatro,
quatro.setInputSource(srcMatched);
quatro.setInputTarget(tgtMatched);
Eigen::Matrix4d output;
quatro.computeTransformation(output);
```

* Robust global registration performance

  - As shown in the below figures, our method shows the most promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
  - It could be over-claim, yet our method would be more appropriate for terrestrial mobile platforms. Reducing the degree of freedom (DoF) usually makes algorithms be more robust against errors by projecting them into a lower dimension.
      - E.g. 3D-3D correspondences -> 3D-2D correspondences, LOAM -> LeGO-LOAM
  - In this context, our method is the dimension-reduced version of [TEASER++](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/TEASER-plusplus)!

### Test Env.

The code is tested successfully at
* Linux 18.04 LTS
* ROS Melodic

## How to Build

### ROS Setting
1. Install the following dependencies

```
sudo apt install cmake libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev
```

2. Install [ROS](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html) on a machine.
3. Then, build Quatro package and enjoy! :) We use [catkin tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:url-kaist/Quatro.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build quatro 
```

**Note** Quatro requires `pmc` library, which is automatically installed via `3rdparty/find_dependencies.cmake`. 

## How to Run Quatro

### Prerequisites

In this study, fast point feature histogram (FPFH) is utilized, which is widely used as a conventional descriptor for the registration. However, the original FPFH for a 3D point cloud captured by a 64-channel LiDAR sensor takes **tens of seconds**, which is too slow.  In summary, still, feature extraction & matching is the bottleneck for global registration :worried: (in fact, the accuracy is not very important because Quatro is extremely robust against outliers!).

For this reason, we employ voxel-sampled FPFH, which is preceded by voxel-sampling. This is followed by the correspondence test. In addition, we employ [Patchwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05560), which is the state-of-the-art method for ground segmentation, and image projection to reject some subclusters, which is proposed in [Le-GO-LOAM](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/LeGO-LOAM). These modules are not presented in our paper! 

Finally, we can reduce the computational time of feature extraction & matching, i.e. the front-end of global registration, from tens of seconds to almost 0.2 sec. The overall pipeline is as follows:

#### Note

For fine-tuning of the parameters to use this code in your own situations, please refer to `config` folder. In particular, for fine-tuning of Patchwork, please refer to [this Wiki](https://github.com/LimHyungTae/patchwork/wiki/4.-IMPORTANT:-Setting-Parameters-of-Patchwork-in-Your-Own-Env.)

### TL;DR
1. ~Download toy pcd bins files~ 
  
~The point clouds are from the KITTI dataset, so these are captured by Velodyne-64-HDE~

Toy pcds are automatically downloaded. If there is a problem, follow the below commands:

```
roscd quatro
cd materials
wget https://urserver.kaist.ac.kr/publicdata/quatro/000540.bin
wget https://urserver.kaist.ac.kr/publicdata/quatro/001319.bin
```

2. Launch the roslaunch file as follows:

```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 roslaunch quatro quatro.launch
```

(Unfortunately, for the first run, it shows rather slow and imprecise performance. It may be due to multi-thread issues.)
